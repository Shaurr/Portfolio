## [BAProject](https://github.com/Shaurr/ProjectM)

* C#, Unity2D

Game developed for my bachelor thesis. It is a tool to analyse the influence of diverse indicators for the weak spots of bosses on the gameplay. Therefore, the player fights through a boss rush, where each boss uses different indicators. The game also collects data for evaluation during the gameplay.

This game is based on particle systems. In this game the player must pilot his spaceship through space and doge hostile objects. His goal is to survive as many waves of enemies as possible and set the highest score. These waves are randomly generated and increase in difficulty. Alongside the enemies can additionally spawn helpful items, like health and special attacks.

## MANA
* C#, Unity3D, SteamVR

A game developed by around 40 students over two semesters.
It is a 2 vs. 2 multiplayer VR game, where you play as a sorcerer. Together with your friend you fight against a team of two opposing sorcerers over the domination of the arena. This arena consists of pillars flying in the sky. Conquer more pillars than the enemy through strategic use of spells and good teamwork to win the game.
I was part of the team of programmers and worked on the function of the spells and on the technical side of the UI.
